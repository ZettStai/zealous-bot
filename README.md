# zealous-bot

zeal
/zÄ“l/
noun
great energy or enthusiasm in pursuit of a cause or an objective.

This bot started as a fan project for a Carmilla server. The original code for that bot can be found [here](https://github.com/ZettStai/carmilla-bot).

In this project I want to rewrite this bot in Python to utilize the skills I'm already using on a daily basis in my day job. The first step is to have this bot completely rewritten to work with Python.
